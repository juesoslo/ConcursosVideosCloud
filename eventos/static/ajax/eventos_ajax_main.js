   This protection is only against a single user pressing buttons as fast
   as they can. This is in no way a protection against a real DDOS attack,
   of which almost 100% bypass the client (browser) (they instead
   directly attack the server). Hence client-side protection is pointless.

   The protection is implemented via Underscore.js' debounce function:
  - http://underscorejs.org/#debounce

   Using this only requires importing underscore-min.js. underscore-min.map
   is not needed.
